# Introduction
ParselCode is a project started at HackBU 2016. The idea is basically to convert speech to Python code. 

# Future Changes
This project is very far from being done with lots of changes needing to be implented. Currently it can only convert from the word define into actual python code. There was already more implemented but I want to redesign this project using objects. Eventually I want to be able to write code live instead of using a .wav file.
